The solution utilizes Firebase's `transaction()` method to ensure atomic operations on the counter.  This guarantees that even with concurrent updates, the counter will be incremented correctly.

```javascript
// corrected code
firebase.database().ref('counter').transaction(function(currentCount) {
  return (currentCount || 0) + 1;
});
```
This transaction ensures that the increment operation is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. The database server guarantees that no other operations can interfere during the transaction, preventing data loss and race conditions.
