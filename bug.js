The issue stems from an improper use of Firebase's Realtime Database transactions.  Specifically, the transaction function doesn't account for potential race conditions where multiple clients attempt to update the same data concurrently.  This results in inconsistent data and unexpected behavior.  The provided code only increments a counter, but without a transaction, two simultaneous increments might only result in a single increment, losing data.

```javascript
// buggy code
firebase.database().ref('counter').once('value').then(function(snapshot){
  let count = snapshot.val() || 0;
  firebase.database().ref('counter').set(count + 1);
});
```
